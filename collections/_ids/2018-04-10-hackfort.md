#Hackfort

I did a thing at hackfort in 2018 where we created a chatbot using Google's Dialog Flow, wired it into a user on Forsta's chat app wired that chatbot user onto a Raspberry Pi Zero connecting it to the IO pins on it - and thus - made a LED blink by chatting the word 'blink' to that user! 

I need to rewrite that blog post here though as Forsta went under and didn't save my blog post there!
