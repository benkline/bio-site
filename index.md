# Hi! <span style='font-size:100px;'>&#128512;</span>

I'm Ben Kline, a freelance developer, instructional designer, and multimedia producer. This is my bio-site.

## Thanks for visiting!

If you need help with anything, or know of a project or position you think I might be a good fit for, feel free to contact me via the links in the footer.

Please checkout my <a href="https://github.com/benkline?tab=repositories"><i class="github icon"></i>Github Page. </a>

My portfolio and blog are available in the upper left menu.

**You could also have a chat with BK-Bot,**. It's definitely a work in progress :smile:, but the plan is that it will let me know someone is here and answer any questions until I can in join the conversation from my phone or other device--but for now, it's just a toy. Until then, please use one of the methods in the footer to contact me. Thanks!
