## Hi! :smiley:

I'm Ben Kline, a freelance developer, instructional designer, and multimedia producer.

This is my portfolio and blog site. Thanks for visiting!

I hope you'll learn a bit about me any my work, and then contact me about a project or position you think I might be a good fit for.

My portfolio of work is available via the above menu. The blog posts below are a mix of what I find of interesting -- like developer how-to's, musings, ramblings, diatribes, and maybe a short story or two.


Please feel free to contact me via any of the methods available in the footer below!
