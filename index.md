# Hi!

I'm Ben Kline, a freelance developer, instructional designer, and multimedia producer. This is my portfolio and blog site. Thanks for visiting!

I hope you'll learn a bit about me and then contact me about a project or position you think I might be a good fit for.

My portfolio of work is available via the above menu, sorted by the types of work I do. The blog posts below are a mix of what I find of interesting -- like developer how-to's, musings, ramblings, diatribes, and maybe a short story or two.

Please feel free to contact me via any of the methods available in the footer below!
