Hi, I am Ben Kline, a freelance developer, instructional designer, and multimedia producer. This is my portfolio and blog site; thanks for visiting! I hope you'll learn a bit about me and then contact me about a project or position you think I might be a good fit for.

Please feel free to contact me via any of the methods in the footer below <img class="emoji" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f603.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">

My portfolio of work is available in the nav section above, sorted by the types of work I do. The blog posts below are a mix of what I find of interesting like developer how-to's, long form ramblings that don't really fit in the context of social media, and maybe a short story or two. Thanks for checking it out!
